# Puzzle

GENERAL DESCRIPTION
**Solving XOR problem with a simple MLP in a Puzzle Game Project.
**It is an Android Game
**It has a plain ANN which calculates only the XOR
**Most of the code has written in Turkish language because it was my graduation project.

WHAT DID I DO?
**By using fibonacci sequence, we define the levels and their trials.
**By calculating XOR with the time user played and the results he get, we can calculate the progress.

FUTURE WORKS
**The aim is improving visual mind by NOT bothering the users.(I know many people don't like puzzles)
**Turn this project into a base of a framework which can be useful in similar projects in near future

It is an Android game after all. By discovering, have fun :)
