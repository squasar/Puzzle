GENERAL DESCRIPTION
**Solving XOR problem with a simple MLP in a Puzzle Game Project.
**It is my graduation project.

WHAT DID I DO?
**By using fibonacci sequence, we define levels and their trials.
**By calculating XOR with the time user played and the results he get, we can calculate the progress.

FUTURE WORKS
**The aim is improving visual mind by not bothering the users
**Turn this project into a base of a framework which can be useful in similar projects in future

It is an Android game. Have fun :)
