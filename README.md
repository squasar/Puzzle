# Puzzle

GENERAL DESCRIPTIONS <br />
<br />
**Solving XOR problem with a simple MLP in a Puzzle Game Project.<br />
**It is an Android Game<br />
**It has a plain ANN which calculates only the XOR<br />
**Most of the code has written in Turkish language because it was my graduation project.<br />

<br />
<br />

WHAT DID I DO?...<br />
<br />
**By using fibonacci sequence, we define the levels and their trials.<br />
**By calculating XOR with the time user played and the results he get, we can calculate the progress.<br />

<br />
<br />

FUTURE WORKS<br />
<br />
**The aim is improving visual mind by NOT bothering the users. (I know many people don't like puzzles)<br />
**Turn this project into a base of a framework which can be useful in similar projects in near future<br />

<br />
<br />

WARNINGS!<br />
<br />
**Some easy modifications had not written completely but specified.<br />

It is an Android game after all. Have fun by discovering and playing :)<br />
